                History
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">The Colosseum, originally known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, stands as an enduring symbol of Imperial Rome's power and architectural prowess. Construction began under Emperor Vespasian around 70-72 AD and was largely completed by his son Titus in 80 AD, with further modifications by Domitian. Built partly on the site of Nero's extravagant Domus Aurea, its purpose was to host gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, public executions, battle reenactments, and other spectacles designed to entertain the Roman populace and showcase imperial might.

Capable of holding an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators, the Colosseum was a marvel of Roman engineering, featuring intricate systems for managing crowds, retractable awnings (velarium) for shade, and a sophisticated underground network known as the hypogeum, complete with tunnels, cages, and elevators to bring gladiators and animals to the arena floor. The games were immensely popular, often lasting for days, and were used by emperors to gain public favor.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, the Colosseum fell into disuse and decay. Its immense structure was repurposed over centuries: sections served as housing, workshops, a fortress, and even a Christian shrine. Perhaps most significantly, it became a vast quarry, its travertine and marble stripped away to build Renaissance palaces and churches across Rome. Despite this plunder, the Colosseum’s core structure remained largely intact, saved from complete demolition by its designation as a sacred site for early Christian martyrs. Today, following extensive restoration efforts, it stands as one of the world's most recognizable and visited archaeological sites, a testament to Rome's enduring legacy.</p>
