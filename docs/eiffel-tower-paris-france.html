                History
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">The Eiffel Tower, an iconic symbol of Paris and France, was conceived as the grand entrance to the 1889 Universal Exposition, a world's fair held to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. Designed by Gustave Eiffel's company, with chief engineers Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, and architect Stephen Sauvestre, its construction was a remarkable feat of engineering for its time. Built from puddled iron, the tower's assembly began in January 1887 and concluded in a record-breaking two years, two months, and five days, opening to the public on March 31, 1889.

Initially, the tower was met with significant resistance and criticism from many French artists and intellectuals who deemed it an eyesore or a 'tragic streetlamp.' However, it quickly captivated the public imagination and became the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years. Though originally intended to be a temporary structure, slated for dismantling after 20 years, its utility as a radio antenna proved invaluable, particularly during World War I, when it played a crucial role in intercepting enemy communications. This strategic importance saved it from demolition.

Over the decades, the Eiffel Tower has transitioned from a temporary exhibition piece to an enduring monument, a testament to industrial innovation and a powerful emblem of French culture and ingenuity. It has hosted countless events, witnessed historical moments, and undergone numerous renovations and paint jobs. Today, standing at 330 meters tall (including its antenna), it continues to draw millions of visitors annually, cementing its status as one of the most recognizable and beloved landmarks on the planet.</p>
